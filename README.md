# Sperm-storage
Read me for Humans_abstinence dataset
Row: Row number/effect size number
Paper: Study ID
Cohort: Cohort ID within study
Title: paper title
Aim: whether study is explicitly interested in abstinence or not
Year: Year of publication
DOI: doi
Country: country where males were sampled in
Condition: whether sampled males were fertile, or had some problems related to sperm/infertility
Male age: average/range of ages of males used in study
Data_ from: part of the paper from which data has been collected
Trait_description: how the trait was described in the study
Trait: what the trait was coded as for the meta-analysis
Broad_trait: whether the trait is a whole-sperm trait, intra-cellular sperm trait, or post-fertilisation trait
Dura min: minimum duration of sexual abstinence of males in the study
Dura max: maximum duration of sexual abstinence of males in the study
Age1 to Ag17: when males are in different groups of sperm storage duration, this column tells us what the duration of sperm storage is for that group
X1 to x17: when males are in different groups of sperm storage duration, this column tells us what the means of the trait are with the associated duration of sperm storage
Sd1 to sd17: when males are in different groups of sperm storage duration, this column tells us what the SD of the trait is with the associated duration of sperm storage and mean of the trait
Se1 to se17: when males are in different groups of sperm storage duration, this column tells us what the SE of the trait is with the associated duration of sperm storage and mean of the trait
N_unique: the unique number of males associated with that effect size/row
N_total: the total number of males associated with that effect size/row. N_total > N_unique when males are repeatedly sampled, such as in longitudinal studies
N_test: the number of males/samples associated with the test statistic, whenever only test statistics are reported
Test_stat: whenever test statistics from a model is reported, the type of test statistic
Value: whenever test statistics from a model is reported, the value for that test statistic
SE_beta: whenever a Beta is reported, the SE associated with that beta for calculation of a t value
CI_low_OR; whenever an odds ratio is reported, the CI associated with the OR
CI_high_OR; whenever an odds ratio is reported, the CI associated with the OR
Calculation: whenever two groups with means and SD/SE are reported, SMD is calculated as the effect size. Whenever multiple groups with means and SD/SE reported, a simulation is used. Whenever means (as %) are reported without SE or SD, a Percent calculation is used. Whenever only model outputs are reported, a TestStat calculation is used to calculate effect sizes.
Multiplier: the multiplier to be finally multiplied with the effect size, so that higher values imply higher sperm quality/fitness, while -ve values imply lower sperm quality/fitness.
Sampling: whether males were sampled cross sectionally (i.e. different sperm storage groups having different samples of males) or longitudinally (repeated sampling).
Study type: whether study was conducted retrospectively (i.e. analysis carried out on existing data, without males being assigned to different experimental groups before the start of the study), or prospectively (males assigned to different experimental groups at the start of the study).
